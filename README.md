# dashboard-design

This is me attempting to build https://dribbble.com/shots/2449045-Portfolio-Screen from scratch.

To use this repo, first `npm install` everything.

You can build the css by running `gulp sass`, or just `gulp` if you want to watch the sass files.

Run `http-server` in the root directory to start the server.

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser and bask in my amazing copycat front end skills.
